Project Goal:
An alternative rule matching tool of PANOS 'Test Policy Match'
An alternative object lookup tool of PANOS 'Global Find'

PANOS 'Test Policy Match' limitations:
1. must provide exlicit host IP of source and destination, i.e. can't use subnet
2. must provide Destination port in case of UDP and TCP
3. must select one of 3 protocols - TCP/UDP/ICMP
4. either include single matching rule only, or does not display consequent potentially matching rule after first match

PANOS 'Global Find' limitations:
1. exact match of address object, not suitable to find shadowing objects, i.e. find the subnet (or range) object which covers a particular ip address
2. lack of house keeping capability, such like list redundant object and unused object

Typical tasks this project aims to solve:
1. given a source/destination IP address or a subnet, list all the potentially matching rules, regardless other conditions such like port and applications.
2. find duplicate address object
3. find unused object

Note: The task list of this project may extend. The development of coding may take several stages and focus on one function at a time
